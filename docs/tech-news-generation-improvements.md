# Tech News Generation Improvements

## Current Issues Identified

Based on the recent execution of our tech news generation system, we've identified several critical issues:

1. **JSON Parsing Failures**: The Perplexity API responses include thinking processes (`<think>` tags) and markdown code blocks that break our JSON parser.

2. **Hallucinated Content**: The LLM is generating news items with:
   - Non-existent URLs (404 errors)
   - Future-dated content (e.g., TypeScript 6.0, which doesn't exist yet)
   - Fabricated news items that can't be verified

3. **Verification Process Failures**: The verification step is also failing due to similar parsing issues when processing responses.

4. **Correction Mechanism Failures**: The correction attempts are failing for the same parsing-related reasons.

## Proposed Improvements

### 1. Robust JSON Parsing

- **Implement a Multi-Stage Parser**:
  - Use a more sophisticated regex pattern to extract JSON content from various formats
  - Add fallback mechanisms to handle different response structures
  - Implement JSON schema validation before accepting parsed content

- **Pre-Processing Step**:
  - Strip all markdown formatting before attempting to parse
  - Remove all thinking process tags and content
  - Normalize whitespace and special characters

### 2. Hallucination Prevention

- **Two-Stage Generation Process**:
  1. First query: Get recent, verifiable tech news topics only
  2. Second query: Generate detailed content only for verified topics

- **Source Verification Before Content Generation**:
  - Verify URLs exist before including them in news items
  - Check publication dates to ensure content is not future-dated
  - Use a curated list of trusted sources as a reference

- **Fact Grounding**:
  - Include specific instructions to only report on verifiable news
  - Provide a list of trusted sources for each category
  - Implement a "citation needed" flag for claims that require verification

### 3. Improved Verification Process

- **Independent Verification Sources**:
  - Use a different API or model for verification than for generation
  - Implement web search to cross-reference claims
  - Check multiple sources before accepting a news item

- **Structured Verification Protocol**:
  1. URL validation (check if the URL exists and returns 200)
  2. Content validation (check if the URL content matches the news item)
  3. Date validation (ensure the news is recent and not future-dated)
  4. Source reputation check (verify the domain is trustworthy)

- **Confidence Scoring System**:
  - Implement a weighted scoring system for verification
  - Require a minimum threshold for acceptance
  - Flag items with borderline scores for human review

### 4. Enhanced Correction Mechanism

- **Structured Correction Workflow**:
  1. Identify specific issues (URL, content, dates)
  2. Search for alternative sources for the same news
  3. Generate corrected content with proper attribution
  4. Re-verify the corrected content

- **Human-in-the-Loop Option**:
  - Flag items that fail automatic correction for human review
  - Provide an interface for manual correction
  - Log all manual corrections for future training

### 5. Technical Implementation Improvements

- **Error Handling and Logging**:
  - Implement comprehensive error handling at each step
  - Create detailed logs for debugging
  - Set up alerts for systematic failures

- **Response Format Enforcement**:
  - Use more explicit instructions in system prompts
  - Implement retry logic with different prompting strategies
  - Consider using structured output formats like JSON mode

- **API Fallbacks**:
  - Implement fallback to alternative LLM providers if primary fails
  - Create a queue system for retrying failed requests
  - Cache successful responses to reduce API calls

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Robust Parsing and Error Handling

1. Refactor the `parseNewsContent` function with enhanced regex patterns
2. Add comprehensive error handling and logging
3. Implement validation checks at each step of the process

### Phase 2: Verification Improvements

1. Develop a more robust URL validation system
2. Implement source reputation checking
3. Create a confidence scoring system for verification

### Phase 3: Two-Stage Generation Process

1. Modify the news generation workflow to separate topic selection from content generation
2. Implement fact grounding with trusted sources
3. Add pre-verification of topics before detailed content generation

### Phase 4: Enhanced Correction System

1. Develop a structured correction workflow
2. Implement search capabilities to find alternative sources
3. Create a human review interface for failed corrections

## Conclusion

The current tech news generation system is encountering significant issues with hallucinated content and parsing failures. By implementing the proposed improvements, we can create a more robust system that generates factually accurate, verifiable news content while handling API responses more effectively.

This will require significant refactoring of the current codebase, but the investment will result in a more reliable and trustworthy news generation system.
