### **How You Approach Technical Documentation**

#### **Example: How You Might Document a Feature**

**After (Your Style: Personal & Thoughtful)**  
> Burnout isn’t just about working too much—it’s about feeling trapped between expectations and reality. For me, it hit when I realized that no matter how efficient I became, the work would never be _done_. The real challenge wasn’t working less—it was redefining what _enough_ looked like.
