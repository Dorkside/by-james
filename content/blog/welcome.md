# Welcome to My Dev Blog

This is my first blog post using Nuxt Content. Here I'll be sharing my development insights, experiences, and thoughts about technology.

## Why I Started This Blog

I believe in sharing knowledge and experiences with the developer community. Through this blog, I aim to:

- Share technical insights
- Document my learning journey
- Help other developers
- Build a community

## Code Example

Here's a simple example of how to use async/await in JavaScript:

```js
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    const data = await response.json()
    return data
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error)
  }
}
```

Stay tuned for more posts!
