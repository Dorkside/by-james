# My Agentic Coding Workflow: Roo Code Meets SPARC

Software development is moving fast. Tools are getting smarter, but also more complex. Roo Code, used with the SPARC method, gave me a way to work *with* AI agents—without losing control of the process.

I moved on from Cursor after getting weaker results and seeing the price go up too quickly. Roo Code felt more reliable. It gave me space to think, plan, and stay focused while the agents handled the actual code.

Let’s be honest: agentic coding still burns through credits fast. But while Roo’s agents keep working in the background, I can stay busy reading docs or digging up whatever I need next. It’s like having nonstop interns—except they cost money and don’t sleep.

## Why SPARC Works for Me

SPARC (Specification, Pseudocode, Architect, Refine, Code) isn’t a checklist. It’s a flexible process I jump in and out of as needed. It helps break the work into clear steps and avoids surprises.

- **S – Specification**: I describe the goal. The Spec Writer agent asks follow-up questions until we land on something clear. This phase either brings clarity—or shows the idea needs more work.

- **P – Pseudocode**: The agent outlines the logic and flow. No real code yet, just structure. It helps spot gaps early.

- **A – Architect**: For bigger tasks, I guide the overall shape of the solution or use a mode built for that. It makes sure the base is solid.

- **R – Refine**: After tests pass, the Refinement mode cleans up the code. I check names, structure, and make sure nothing weird slipped through.

- **C – Code**: Auto-Coder writes just enough code to pass the tests. It keeps things simple. No extras, no surprises.

Each part creates something useful—something I can read, improve, or toss. It’s easy to go back a step without messing everything up.

## What This Changes

This isn’t about replacing developers. It’s about making it easier to stay in flow. I get to spend more time thinking and solving, and less time switching tabs or getting lost in boilerplate.

What would make it even better? More control over checkpoints and validation. Sometimes the agents take a wrong turn. A UI that shows progress clearly would help fix problems earlier, without needing to dig through all the steps manually.

If you already think in terms of systems and flow, this setup makes sense fast. You’re not giving up control—you’re getting more time and focus back. And yes, you’re trading some credits for it.

It’s not magic. But it’s helpful enough to keep using—and exploring.
